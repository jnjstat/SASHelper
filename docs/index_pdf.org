* Introduction
SAS Helper is a convenient tool to help SAS users to view SAS datasets.
** Features
- High performance and much faster than SAS Universal Viewer
- Flexible and efficient dataset filter system, three ways to filter data:
 - One key shortcut
 - Context menu
 - Edit the filter manually
- Subset an entire library of data for the patient you're following using library filter
 - A Library filter will be applied to all datasets from the same library.
 - It will have no effect on datasets from another library.
- Keep all your favorite library paths in the workspace for instant access
- Quickly find the frequency of one/multiple variables without having to write any SAS code
- Count unique USUBJIDs by one/multiple variables
- Hide/Unhide variables
- Variables reorder
- Support simple SAS statements, such as KEEP, DROP, TABLE.
- Support both *.sas7bdat* and *.xpt*

** Prerequisite
- OS: 64 bits Windows system, such as Windows 10, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise.
